## Description
Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names. This app takes a user's birthday on the form provided and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.
